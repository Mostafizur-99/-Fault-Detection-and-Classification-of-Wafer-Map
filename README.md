# Fault-Detection-and-Classification-of-Wafer-Map

 In semiconductor manufacturing, the detection and classifi
cation of defects on wafer maps play a crucial role in ensuring
 the production of high-quality integrated circuits. This paper
 presents a novel approach to wafer map fault classification
 leveraging Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
 The proposed method aims to automate the identification and
 categorization of faults on semiconductor wafers, enhancing
 the efficiency and accuracy of the quality control process. The
 CNN architecture is designed to extract hierarchical features
 from wafer maps, allowing for the recognition of complex
 patterns associated with various types of defects.
